Welcome to OpenCTF documentation!
=================================

OpenCTF is a new multipurpose CTF platform, developed for use in `EasyCTF 2016 <https://easyctf.com>`_, but can be used to deploy a CTF anywhere! Featuring an easy installation process and a full admin panel, OpenCTF serves CTF organizers who may not want to spend the effort writing their own platform.

Check out our `Getting Started <gettingstarted.html>`_ page for instructions on how to quickly set up and deploy your own instance of this CTF platform.
