LibreCTF
========

Open-source CTF platform from EasyCTF.

Project status
--------------

I'm trying to revive this project to be used for several other CTFs, so
there'll be a bit more activity for now. The goal is for organizers to be able
to get it up and running with minimal effort.

## Getting Started

To deploy the platform, edit the .env file with details about the deployment:

```
TODO
```

then run

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Importing CTF Information

CTF information is configured through a set of files. It's recommended to use a
git repository to manage this information so it can be edited among multiple
organizers.

Specify either a directory to read this information from or a git repository.
